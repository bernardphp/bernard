Bernard
=======

Welcome to Bernard's documentation!

Bernard is a task queue implemented in PHP. It makes it easier to create distributed
systems by using a structured message format. Bernard has its roots in Resque and
supports Redis and many of its features. For the very adventurous people, it should
be possible to send Bernard messages to Requeue and vice versa.

The basic model that Bernard is build after is the PHP implementation of the
"Producer-Consumer" design pattern.
