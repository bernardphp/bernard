Bernard
=======

Bernard is a message queue implemented in php. It is very similiar to Resque and
allows for easy creation of workers and creating distributed systems.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/henrikbjorn/Bernard.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/henrikbjorn/Bernard)

Getting Started
---------------

Bernard allows you as Resque to create messages and place them on a queue, and
later on pull those off the queue and process them. It is not a complete
solution to have any object method being called at a later time (as resque).

### Installing

The easiest way to install Bernard is by using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).
If your projects do not already use this, it is highly recommended to start.

``` bash
$ composer require henrikbjorn/bernard:dev-master
```

Then look at what kind of drivers and serializers there is available and install their dependencies
before use.

### Examples

In the `example` directory there are two examples of running Bernard. `producer.php` will
connect to redis on localhost and produce `EchoTime` messages. `consumer.php` will consume
theese and print the timestamp.

`in_memory.php` will produce 20 `EchoTime` messages and consume them right they
have been sent. It uses `SplQueue` and does not need a redis backend.

### Configuring a Driver

Several different types of drivers are supported. Currently theese are available:

* `PhpRedisDriver` for the [redis](http://pecl.php.net/package/redis) extension.
* `PredisDriver` for the [Predis](http://github.com/nrk/predis) library.

#### PhpRedisDriver

Requires the installation of the pecl extension. You can add the following to your `composer.json` file
to make sure it is installed:

``` json
{
    "require" : {
        "ext-redis" : "~2.2"
    }
}
```

And then instanciate the correct driver object.

``` php
<?php

use Bernard\Driver\PhpRedisDriver;

$redis = new Redis();
$redis->connect('127.0.0.1', 6379);
$redis->setOption(Redis::OPT_PREFIX, 'bernard:');

$driver = new PhpRedisDriver($redis);
```

#### PredisDriver

Requires the installation of predis. Add the following to your composer.json file for this:

``` json
{
    "require" : {
        "predis/predis" : "~0.8"
    }
}
```

And then instanciate the correct driver object.

``` php
<?php

use Bernard\Driver\PredisDriver;
use Predis\Client;

$predis = new Client('tcp://localhost', array(
    'prefix' => 'bernard:',
));

$driver = new PredisDriver($predis);
```

### Producing Messages

Any message sent to Bernard must be an instance of `Bernard\Message`
which have a `getName` and `getQueue` method. `getName` is used when working on
messages and identifies the worker service that should work on it.

A message is given to a producer that sends the message to the right queue.
It is also possible to get the queue directly from the queue factory and push
the message there. But remember to wrap the message in an `Envelope` object.
The easiest way is to give it to the producer as the queue name
is taken from the message object.

To make it easier to send messages and not require every type to be implemented
in a seperate class, a `Bernard\Message\DefaultMessage` is provided. It can hold
any number of proberties and only needs a name for the message. The queue name
is then generated from that. When generating the queue name it will insert a "_"
before any uppercase letters and then lowercase everything.

Messages are serialized to json using [JMS Serializer](http://jmsyst.com/libs/serializer).
Therefore an instance of that is required. Also if custom message classes are
used it is needed to add metadata for being able to serialize and deserialize them.

``` php
<?php

use Bernard\Message\DefaultMessage;
use Bernard\Message\Envelope;
use Bernard\Producer;
use Bernard\QueueFactory\PersistentFactory;
use Bernard\Serializer\JMSSerializer;

// .. create serializer instance where src/Bernard/Resources/serializer
// is registered as a metadata dir with "Bernard" as prefix.
$serializer = new JMSSerializer($jmsSerializer);

// .. create driver
$factory = new PersistentFactory($driver, $serializer);
$producer = new Producer($factory);

$message = new DefaultMessage("SendNewsletter", array(
    'newsletterId' => 12,
));

$producer->produce($message);

// or give it to a queue directly. The queue will be created if it doesn't exist
$factory->create('my-queue')->enqueue(new Envelope($message));
```

#### In Memory Queues

Bernard comes with an implemention for `SplQueue` which is completly in memory.
It is useful for development and/or testing, when you don't necessarily want actions to be
performed.

### Consuming Messages

A single message represents a job that needs to be performed, and as described
earlier, a message's name is used to determine which service object should
receive that message.

A service object can be any object that has a method corresponding to the message
name prefixed with `on`. So `new DefaultMessage('SendNewsletter')` will trigger a
call to `$serviceObject->onSendNewsletter`. For the system to know which service
object should handle which messages, your are required to register them first.

``` php
<?php

use Bernard\ServiceResolver\ObjectResolver;
use Bernard\Consumer;

// .. create driver and a queuefactory
// NewsletterMessageHandler is a pseudo service object that responds to
// onSendNewsletter.

$serviceResolver = new ObjectResolver;
$serviceResolver->register('SendNewsletter', new NewsletterMessageHandler);

// Bernard also comes with a service resolver for Pimple (Silex) which allows you
// to use service ids and have your service object lazy loader.
//
// $serviceResolver = new \Bernard\Pimple\PimpleAwareResolver($pimple);
// $serviceResolver->register('SendNewsletter', 'my.service.id');
//
// Symfony DependencyInjection component is also supported.
//
// $serviceResolver = new \Bernard\Symfony\ContainerAwareServiceResolver($container);
// $serviceResolver->register('SendNewsletter', 'my.service.id');

// Create a Consumer and start the loop. The second argument is optional and
// is the queue failed messages should be added to. The last argument (array) is also optional
// and the defaults can be seen in the Consumer class.
$consumer = new Consumer($serviceResolver);
$consumer->consume($queueFactory->create('send-newsletter'), $queueFactory->create('failed'), array(
    'max-runtime' => 900,
    'max-retries' => 5,
));
```

Bernard comes with a `ConsumeCommand` which can be used with Symfony Console 
component.

``` php
<?php

use Bernard\Symfony\Command\ConsumeCommand;

// create $console application
$console->add(new ConsumeCommand($services, $queueManager));
```

It can then be used as any other console command. The argument given should be
the queue that your messages are on. If we use the earlier example with sending
a newsletter, it would look like this.

``` bash
$ /path/to/console bernard:consume 'send-newsletter'
```

Serializers
-----------

Bernard supports multiple serializers to serialize messages for persistent storage such as Predis, Redis and so
on. So far the examples have been using JMS as it was the first supported.

JMS Serializer is only recommended if you already uses this serializer or have advanced serialization needs in
your application.

### Symfony Serializer

It is important that the serializer uses `Bernard\Symfony\EnvelopeNormalizer` and the `JsonEncoder` to being able
to serialize and deserialize messages.

``` php
<?php

use Bernard\Serializer\SymfonySerializer;
use Bernard\Symfony\EnvelopeNormalizer;
use Symfony\Component\Serializer\Encoder\JsonEncoder;
use Symfony\Component\Serializer\Serializer;

$symfonySerializer = new Serializer(array(new EnvelopeNormalizer), array(new JsonEncoder);
$serializer = new SymfonySerializer($symfonySerializer);
```

### JMS Serializer

Using JMS Serializer is only possible when the subscribing handler have been added.

``` php
<?php

use Bernard\Serializer\JMSSerializer;
use Bernard\JMSSerializer\EnvelopeHandler;
use JMS\Serializer\SerializerBuilder;

$jmsSerializer = SerializerBuilder::create()
    ->configureHandlers(function ($registry) {
        $registry->registerSubscribingHandler(new EnvelopeHandler);
    })
    ->build()
;

$serializer = new JMSSerializer($jmsSerializer);
```

Integration with Frameworks
---------------------------

To make it easier to get started and have it "just work" with sending messages,
a number of integrations have been created.

* __Silex__: [BernardServiceProvider](https://github.com/henrikbjorn/BernardServiceProvider)

Monitoring
----------

Having a message queue where it is not possible to know what is in the queue and the
contents of the messages is not very handy, so for that there is [Juno](https://github.com/henrikbjorn/Juno).

It is implemented in Silex and is very lightweight. Also if needed, it can be
embedded in other Silex or Flint applications.

Alternatives
------------

If this is not your cup of tea there are other alternatives that might be
better suited to your needs.
